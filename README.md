Hybrid Instructors
========


As an instructor (Luciano)
So that my students can gain confidence with testing rails
I want some solid materials on using rspec with rails that are totally up to date

As an instructor (Armando)
So that I can certify my students 
I want to grade their work on a server

As an instructor (Rose)
So that my students can understand how they are being graded
I'd like the grading specs and process to be transparent
